# Pastry Cream

- 1 cup milk
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 1/3 cup sugar
- pinch of salt
- cornstarch - see note
- 1 tbsp vanilla extract / bean paste
- 4-6 egg yolks
- 3 tbsp butter

#### _Note on cornstarch:_

the amount of cornstarch will dictate the final thickness.
- No cornstarch results in a runny creme anglaise (pouring custard)
- use 30 grams for a thin pastry cream.
- use 40 grams for a medium thickness (eclairs)
- use 50 grams for a firm thickness (cream puffs, creme diplomat, creme chiboust)
- use 60 grams for creams which will be thinned (mousseline cream, German butter cream)

## Instructions

Combine the milk, cream, and vanilla in a microwave-safe dish.

Mix egg yolks, sugar, cornstarh and salt and whisk until smooth.

Heat the cream mixture to a boil and temper the egg mix until incorporated.

Boil carefully for one minute. It's best to do this last boil on the stove
while whisking constantly.  It *can* be done in the microwave but the risk
of curdling is higher.
